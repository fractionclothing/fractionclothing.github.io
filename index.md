title: "Frac/tion Clothing"

Frac/tion is not just another streetwear clothing label. It’s one entrepreneurial boy’s statement that nothing is too big to start doing some small piece of it today. Making art, making clothes, making money. Do what you love doing and then create something people love. Then give from your gain to share that love with others.

Today, Herschel is bringing t-shirts, hoodies, masks, and other accessories that represent his unique style and character. But this is only the beginning. Someday, this will be a part of something bigger. And you can be a part of it, starting today.
